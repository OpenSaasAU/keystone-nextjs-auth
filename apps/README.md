# The Apps Directory

If it is a user-facing app or website, it should live in the `/apps` folder.

Things in the `apps` directory will likely want a `start` script so they can be run, as well as an alias in the root to allow it to be run from the root.

If you don't need to build any apps right now, feel free to delete this. it's okay, you can add it back later.
